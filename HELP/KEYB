NAME

    KEYB - Localized language BIOS extension for DOS


SYNOPSIS

  KEYB  layoutName[,[CP][,filename]]  [/ID:nnn]  [/E] [/9] [/I] [/Dx] [/V]
        [/L=m] [/NOHI] [/B] [/S]
  KEYB [/U]
  KEYB /?


DESCRIPTION

  KEYB enhances or replaces BIOS management of the keyboard, by admitting
  international keyboard layouts. Required data is read from a keyboard
  layout data file, a KL file or a compilation file (such as KEYBOARD.SYS),
  which contains several keyboard descriptors.

  The KEYB data is stored in a separate MCB, loaded in upper memory by
  default.

  A keyboard layout is identified by two labels, a string label, which is
  mandatory (usually a two letter string, such as GR, FR or SP), and an
  optional numeric identifier to distinguish different variants.


OPTIONS

  Parameterless KEYB will show information on the currently loaded KEYB.

  LayoutName    string identifier

  /ID:nnn       Specifies the numeric identifier nnn

  CP            Codepage in which you want KEYB to start (if omitted,
                DISPLAY.SYS and the system are checked)

  filename      The KL file that contains the information for the given layout
                If it is omitted, then KEYBOARD.SYS is tried, otherwise
                <LayoutName>.KL

  /E            Specifies that the keyboard is an AT enhanced keyboard
                (this switch is incompatible with /9)

  /9            Specifies that int9h management services must be activated
                (this switch is incompatible with /E)

  /I            Forces the installation over an already existing keyboard driver

  /Dx           Sets the decimal separator character to x

  /U            Unloads a KEYB previously loaded in memory

  /V            Verbose: shows extra information

  /L=m          Forces the ussage of submapping m, provided that it is compatible
                with current codepage.

  /NOHI         Avoids KEYB to load data into Upper memory, by loading it below
                640Kb
                
  /B            Disables sound alerts (Beep)
  
  /S            Safemode: does not allow un-closed keyboard layout collections
                and blocks strings and other critical commands                

  /?            Shows the fast help


EXAMPLES

  KEYB SP,858

  Loads KEYB with the layout for the Spanish distribution and codepage 858

  KEYB GR,,GR.KL /E

  Loads the German keyboard layout for KEYB, explicitely informing KEYB that
  we are using an enhanced keyboard.
  Use this if KEYB cannot identify the presence of an enhanced keyboard.


BUGS

   None known.
  

RELATED COMMANDS

   KC           Keyboard descriptor files (in KEY) compiler
